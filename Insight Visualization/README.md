# 🧭 Data Presentation & Visualization

## 🎯 Project Goals

The final step of this project transforms structured transcript data into **insightful, easy-to-navigate visualizations**. The goal is to **empower analysts, strategists, and portfolio managers** to explore corporate commentary and sentiment with precision and flexibility.  

By the end of this step, users can:

- 📈 Track thematic **mention trends** over time  
- 🏢 Compare **sector exposure** and **company size dynamics**  
- 🎛️ Use an **interactive dashboard** to explore results across themes, sentiment, clusters, and company-level data  
- 🧠 Derive actionable insights around **market psychology**, **macro trends**, and **emerging narratives**

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. 📊 Thematic Trend Visualization

This module provides high-level and detailed views of how each theme is evolving over time and across the market.

- **Time Series Charts:**  
  Quarterly and monthly mention trends by theme/subtheme. Highlights patterns like rising AI mentions or fading recession talk.

- **YoY / QoQ Momentum Plots:**  
  Track acceleration or deceleration in keyword usage. Useful for spotting new themes or fading narratives.

- **Z-Score Heatmaps:**  
  Quantify current mention intensity relative to historical averages, revealing when themes are unusually hot or cold.

- **Rolling Averages and Seasonality Overlays:**  
  Smooth short-term noise and highlight structural shifts.

### 2. 🧩 Sector & Market Cap Breakdown

This view enables users to segment trends by industry vertical or company size groupings:

- **Sector-Specific Heatmaps:**  
  Shows which sectors are driving or lagging in theme engagement (e.g., AI in Tech vs. Industrials).

- **Bar Charts by Sector & Theme:**  
  Visual comparison of theme penetration across sectors.

- **Company Size Stratification:**  
  Slice results by small-cap, mid-cap, and large-cap buckets. See whether emerging trends are grassroots or led by giants.

### 3. 🕵️ Deep Dive Dashboard

An interactive, user-friendly dashboard allows analysts to explore the data from any angle. Built in Power BI or Python (Dash/Streamlit), it includes:

- **Dynamic Filtering:**  
  Slicers for Theme, Sentiment, Sector, Cluster Label (Engaged/Not Engaged), and Company.

- **Company-Level Views:**  
  Show mention counts, sentiment profiles, embedding clusters, and transcript excerpts.

- **Cluster Visualization:**  
  Integrate PCA/KMeans outputs to separate firms by thematic engagement level.

- **Contextual Insight Cards:**  
  Display real examples of how each company talked about a theme — not just that they mentioned it.

- **Export Options:**  
  Enable quick download of filtered views to Excel or PDF for easy sharing.

### 4. 🧠 Insights Engine (Optional)

Optional layer to enrich the visual outputs with auto-generated text summaries and key takeaways:

- **LLM-Powered Summaries:**  
  Describe how sentiment and frequency evolved over time.

- **Narrative Cards:**  
  Generate 1–2 sentence insights like:  
  > “Mentions of Efficiency jumped 48% QoQ in Industrials, led by cost-cutting commentary from machinery companies.”

- **Alert Flags:**  
  Surface unusually high/low readings, major shifts, or outlier companies.
